Recent advances primarily focus on developing specialized character controllers for individual interaction tasks, such as contacting and carrying, often overlooking the need to establish a unified policy for versatile skills. This limitation hinders the ability to generate high-quality motions across a variety of challenging human-scene interaction tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., walking to a chair and sitting down while carrying a box. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a unified controller designed to synthesize various types of human-scene interaction animations. The key innovation of our framework is the use of tokenized proprioception for the simulated character, combined with various task observations, complemented by a masking mechanism that enables the selection of tasks on demand. In addition, our unified policy network is equipped with flexible input size capabilities, enabling efficient adaptation of learned foundational skills to new environments and tasks. By introducing additional input tokens to the pre-trained policy, we can not only modify interaction targets but also integrate learned skills to address diverse challenges. Overall, our framework facilitates the generation of a wide range of character animations, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in human-scene interactions.","tags":["Physics-based Character Animation","RL"],"title":"TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingxuan Wu","Zhiyang Dou","Sirui Xu","Soshi Shimada","Chen Wang","Zhengming Yu","Yuan Liu","Cheng Lin","Zeyu Cao","Taku Komura","Vladislav Golyanik","Christian Theobalt","Wenping Wang","Lingjie Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"901ff29a8edf78d86b33805c712fabfe","permalink":"/publication/dice-2025/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dice-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Reconstructing 3D hand-face interactions with deformations from a single image is a challenging yet crucial task with broad applications in AR, VR, and gaming. The challenges stem from self-occlusions during single-view hand-face interactions, diverse spatial relationships between hands and face, complex deformations, and the ambiguity of the single-view setting. The first and only method for hand-face interaction recovery, Decaf, introduces a global fitting optimization guided by contact and deformation estimation networks trained on studio-collected data with 3D annotations. However, Decaf suffers from a time-consuming optimization process and limited generalization capability due to its reliance on 3D annotations of hand-face interaction data. To address these issues, we present DICE, the first end-to-end method for Deformation-aware hand-face Interaction reCovEry from a single image. DICE estimates the poses of hands and faces, contacts, and deformations simultaneously using a Transformer-based architecture. It features disentangling the regression of local deformation fields and global mesh vertex locations into two network branches, enhancing deformation and contact estimation for precise and robust hand-face mesh recovery. To improve generalizability, we propose a weakly-supervised training approach that augments the training set using in-the-wild images without 3D ground-truth annotations, employing the depths of 2D keypoints estimated by off-the-shelf models and adversarial priors of poses for supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a standard benchmark and in-the-wild data in terms of accuracy and physical plausibility. Additionally, our method operates at an interactive rate (20 fps) on an Nvidia 4090 GPU, whereas Decaf requires more than 15 seconds for a single image. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.","tags":["hand and face mesh reconstruction","interaction reconstruction"],"title":"DICE: End-to-end Deformation Capture of Hand-Face Interactions from a Single Image","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"DICE was accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional rule-based methods rely on hand-crafted principles, limiting motion diversity and realism in generated collective behaviors. Recent imitation learning methods learn from data but often require ground truth motion trajectories and struggle with authenticity, especially in high-density groups with erratic movements. In this paper, we present a scalable approach, Collective Behavior Imitation Learning (CBIL), for learning fish schooling behavior directly from videos, without relying on captured motion trajectories. Our method first leverages Video Representation Learning, where a Masked Video AutoEncoder (MVAE) extracts implicit states from video inputs in a self-supervised manner. The MVAE effectively maps 2D observations to implicit states that are compact and expressive for following the imitation learning stage. Then, we propose a novel adversarial imitation learning method to effectively capture complex movements of the schools of fish, allowing for efficient imitation of the distribution for motion patterns measured in the latent space. It also incorporates bio-inspired rewards alongside priors to regularize and stabilize training. Once trained, CBIL can be used for various animation tasks with the learned collective motion priors. We further show its effectiveness across different species. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our system in detecting abnormal fish behavior from in-the-wild videos.","tags":["Crowd Animation","Physics-based Character Animation","GAIL","RL"],"title":"CBIL: Collective Behavior Imitation Learning for Fish from Real Videos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sinan Wang","Yitong Deng","Molin Deng","Hong-Xing Yu","Junwei Zhou","Duowen Chen","Taku Komura","Jiajun Wu","Bo Zhu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1733011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723066490,"objectID":"22c59e8de34dc2b700ec9fd31c1615cd","permalink":"/publication/eulerian-2024/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T21:34:50.388741Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eulerian-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an Eulerian vortex method based on the theory of flow maps to simulate the complex vortical motions of incompressible fluids.

However, formulating a robust anisotropic energy that is low-order and yet sufficiently non-linear remains a challenging problem for achieving the convergence promised by Newton-type methods in numerical optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel analytic formulation of an anisotropic energy that is smooth everywhere, low-order, rotationally-invariant and at-least twice differentiable. At its core, our approach utilizes implicit rotation factorizations with invariants of the Cauchy-Green tensor that arises from the deformation gradient. The versatility and generality of our analysis is demonstrated through a variety of examples, where we also show that the constitutive law suggested by the anisotropic version of the well-known \\textit{As-Rigid-As-Possible} energy is the foundational parametric description of both passive and active elastic materials. The generality of our approach means that we can systematically derive the force and force-Jacobian expressions for use in implicit and quasistatic numerical optimization schemes, and we can also use our analysis to rewrite, simplify and speedup several existing anisotropic \\textit{and} isotropic distortion energies with guaranteed inversion-safety.","tags":["Finite Elements","Anisotropy","Orthotropy","Physical Simulation"],"title":"Analytic rotation-invariant modelling of anisotropic finite elements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenyang Zhou","Zhiyang Dou","Zeyu Cao","Zhouyingcheng Liao","Jingbo Wang","Wenjia Wang","Yuan Liu","Taku Komura","Wenping Wang","Lingjie Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1721606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721684090,"objectID":"93e092370f0f8d29cf4625e395793418","permalink":"/publication/emdm-2024/","publishdate":"2024-07-22T21:34:50.388741Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emdm-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce Efficient Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM) for fast and high-quality human motion generation. Current state-of-the-art generative diffusion models have produced impressive results but struggle to achieve fast generation without sacrificing quality. On the one hand, previous works, like motion latent diffusion, conduct diffusion within a latent space for efficiency, but learning such a latent space can be a non-trivial effort. On the other hand, accelerating generation by naively increasing the sampling step size, e.g., DDIM, often leads to quality degradation as it fails to approximate the complex denoising distribution. To address these issues, we propose EMDM, which captures the complex distribution during multiple sampling steps in the diffusion model, allowing for much fewer sampling steps and significant acceleration in generation. This is achieved by a conditional denoising diffusion GAN to capture multimodal data distributions among arbitrary (and potentially larger) step sizes conditioned on control signals, enabling fewer-step motion sampling with high fidelity and diversity. To minimize undesired motion artifacts, geometric losses are imposed during network learning. As a result, EMDM achieves real-time motion generation and significantly improves the efficiency of motion diffusion models compared to existing methods while achieving high-quality motion generation.

Furthermore, we propose a new pipeline that employs a point-based AutoEncoder to learn a compact and continuous latent space for accurately encoding UDF and support high-resolution mesh extraction. We further show that our new pipeline significantly outperforms the prior approaches to learning the distance fields, such as the grid-based AutoEncoder, which is not scalable and incapable of learning accurate UDF. In addition, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy to efficiently embed various surfaces. With the pretrained shape latent space, we employ a latent diffusion model to acquire the distribution of various shapes. Extensive experiments are presented on using Surf-D for unconditional generation, category conditional generation, image conditional generation, and text-to-shape tasks. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Surf-D in shape generation across multiple modalities as conditions.","tags":["Shape Generation","Shape Reconstruction","Topology"],"title":"Surf-D: Generating High-Quality Surfaces of Arbitrary Topologies Using Diffusion Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weilin Wan","Zhiyang Dou","Taku Komura","Wenping Wang","Dinesh Jayaraman","Lingjie Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1721520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721597690,"objectID":"c3da876c9a8d8ba79d434440590271dd","permalink":"/publication/tlcontrol-2024/","publishdate":"2024-07-21T21:34:50.388741Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tlcontrol-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Controllable human motion synthesis is essential for applications in AR/VR, gaming, movies, and embodied AI.

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework for automatic 3D body gesture synthesis from speech. To learn the stochastic nature of the body gesture during speech, we propose a variational transformer to effectively model a probabilistic distribution over gestures, which can produce diverse gestures during inference. Furthermore, we introduce a mode positional embedding layer to capture the different motion speeds in different speaking modes. To cope with the scarcity of data, we design an intra-modal pre-training scheme that can learn the complex mapping between the speech and the 3D gesture from a limited amount of data.

The naive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectly formulated projection matrices. To solve this, we propose Zolly, the first 3DHMR method focusing on perspective-distorted images. Our approach begins with analysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly caused by the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose a new camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, which describes the 2D dense distortion scale of the human body. We then estimate the distance from distortion scale features rather than environment context features. Afterwards, We integrate the distortion feature with image features to reconstruct the body mesh. To formulate the correct projection matrix and locate the human body position, we simultaneously use perspective and weak-perspective projection loss. Since existing datasets could not handle this task, we propose the first synthetic dataset PDHuman and extend two real-world datasets tailored for this task, all containing perspective-distorted human images.

We show how this incongruent trace term can be understood via an implicit relationship to the CG invariants. Our analysis reveals this relationship to be a polynomial where the roots equate to the trace term, and where the derivatives also give rise to closed-form expressions of the Hessian to guarantee positive semi-definiteness for a fast and concise Newton-type implicit time integration. A consequence of this analysis is a novel analytical formulation to compute rotations and singular values of deformation-gradient tensors without explicit/numerical factorization, which is significant, resulting in up to 3.5x speedup and benefits energy function evaluation for reducing solver time. We validate our energy formulation by experiments and comparison, demonstrating that our resulting eigendecomposition using the CG invariants is equivalent to existing ARAP formulations. We thus reveal isotropic ARAP energy to be a member of the \"Cauchy-Green club\", meaning that it can indeed be defined using CG invariants and therefore that the closed-form expressions of the resulting Hessian are shared with other energies written in their terms.","tags":["Mesh geometry models","Physical Simulation"],"title":"Isotropic ARAP energy using Cauchy-Green invariants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiyang Dou","Cheng Lin","Rui Xu","Lei Yang","Shiqing Xin","Taku Komura","Wenping Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610746490,"objectID":"17548a70ad29d93408f8636571decd9a","permalink":"/publication/cat-2022/","publishdate":"2021-01-15T21:34:50.388741Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cat-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present a simple yet effective formulation called Coverage Axis for 3D shape skeletonization.

At the crux of our approach lies a deep neural network with embedded kinematic priors, which decomposes sequences of 2D joint positions into two separate attributes - a single, symmetric, skeleton, encoded by bone lengths, and a sequence of 3D joint rotations associated with global root positions and foot contact labels.","tags":["3D motion reconstruction"],"title":"MotioNet: 3D Human Motion Reconstruction from Monocular Video with Skeleton Consistency","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"/courses/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60abaeb405147d861bb55801d25d30df","permalink":"/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7d752e9f9c21080440d4436b30b9351b","permalink":"/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"850d3285b9d4b0dba29acf3237d91a0c","permalink":"/tools/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tools/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tools","type":"widget_page"}]
